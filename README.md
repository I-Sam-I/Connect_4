# Connect_4
Final Project for CS50x

The game is in the Runner folder. Open the .exe file to play the game.


# Playing the Game
Upon starting, the runner will ask for the number of rows, column, and pieces in a row for a win. The rows and columns won't be too big for your screen. The default values are already selected. After making your choices, click the "Play" button.

Now, Player 1 (red) plays first. To make a move, click in the column you want to play in. Next, Player 2 (yellow) plays. This process continues until someone wins or it;s a tie.


# Game Code
It is ugly.

I use pygame and pygame_gui.
